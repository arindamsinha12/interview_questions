# Python and SQL Coding Interview Questions

I have put together a set of Python and SQL coding questions that are typically asked in interviews, drawing on my experience as both interviewer and interviewee. Some of these are questions I have been asked in actual interviews, some are questions from all over the web and I have provided my answers to them irrespective of whether it is the same as the source or not, and some I have simply thought up as possible questions in an interview.

I have also create a set of [Coding interview Tips](https://github.com/arindamsinha12/interview_questions/blob/main/coding_interview_tips.md) for coding interviews, which will help avoid typical behavioral mistakes that candidates often make.

My strong suggestion is that anyone using this should try to solve the questions first before looking at the answers in an imaginary interview setting. Give yourself 10 minutes to solve each question.
